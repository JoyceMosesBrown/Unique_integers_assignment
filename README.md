Project Overview
This assignment involves developing a Python script to read a list of integers from an input file, identify unique integers, sort them, and then write the sorted list to an output file.

Code Overview
UniqueInt.py: This script is responsible for handling the input files, processing the integers, and producing the output files containing unique, sorted integers.

Input and Output
Input Files: Stored in the sample_inputs_for_student folder.
Output Files: Generated in the sample_results_for_student folder. Each file contains sorted, unique integers from the corresponding input file.

Testing Instructions
Specify the input file path (input_path) and output file path (output_path) in UniqueInt.py.
Run the script to process the input file and generate the sorted output file.
This summary provides an overview of the project objectives, describes the key functions of the script, and gives instructions for testing the script to ensure it processes input files and produces the required output.
